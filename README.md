## **Project Description**
Our team wanted to demonstrate the capability of Bluetooth, motor, and sensor technology, that were learned during class, and demonstrate it in a robot car. With this robot car, users are able to use the Bluefruit Connect app to control the robot car and also receive live temperature readings from the robot car.
